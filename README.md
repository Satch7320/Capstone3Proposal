# Capstone3Proposal

## Idea 1:
Autoencoder idea to create a 'new' M:tG as a continuation of Capstone 2
Implement a UI w/ Flask such that it can transfer the data to an existing website that makes images of the cards to see completed products

## Idea 2:
CNN with https://www.kaggle.com/imsparsh/musicnet-dataset?select=musicnet to learn artist style, instrument sound, or potentially identify key/time signatures

## Idea 3:
Item-Item movie recommender using https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata with a flask interaction such that a person could choose a movie from filtered menus, score it, and receive items that are 'close' or 'far' from the film based on the score
